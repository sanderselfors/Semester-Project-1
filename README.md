## Interview

I interviewed Sofie, a fellow classmate about how she experienced the website:

1. Can you describe your overall experience with the website's design?

- The design is clean and easy to understand. I think the design is appealing and user-friendly. The layout was easy to navigate and the colors are aesthetically pleasing.

2. Were you able to find what you were looking for easily? Why or why not?

- Yes, I was able to find what I was looking for easily. The navigation is simple and easy to understand.

4. Did the website's colors and overall visual design appeal to you? Why or why not?

- Yes, I think the color scheme was consistent throughout the site and the design felt modern and up-to-date.

5. Were there any specific design elements that you found confusing or distracting?

- I found some of the headers on the visit-page to be a little too small compared to the text-paragraphs.

## Report

We have been given a course assignment to improve the website we made for either the HTML/CSS CA website, SemesterProject website, or the Javascript CA website using Hotjar to map how users navigate and experience the website. Then perform an interview to further understand the users experience and then make any improvements to the site based on the feedback.

What I found from the Hotjar recordings was that my website was easy to navigate and caused no confusion. Therefore I did little change to the overall design of the website. I learned from the interview that some of my paragraphs and headings was a little difficult to differentiate on smaller screens, so I added som padding here and there to fix this. Then I went over my code and changed some names here and there to improve it. I also added a new CSS file for the contactform and a README.md to improve the folder structure.

Then I moved on to my contact form. Until now it was just HTML and CSS, so I added Javascript with validation to make it better. It initializes variables for each input field and sets up event listeners for validation. When the user submits the form, it prevents the default action and gets the values from the name, email, and message fields. The "validation" function checks if the input field meets specific requirements using regular expressions. If the input is valid, the "submitContactForm" function is called, which sends the form data to a server.

I also perfomed accessibility testing using Chrome Lighthouse and found that the site has an overall high score.

4. Acknowledgements

First I want to thank Monde Sineke for teaching me a lot of good techniques and ways to execute tasks and problems in our classes. It has given me a lot of inspiration. I also want to thank my classmates and the other teachers we have had this semester for help when I was stuck!

5. Appendices

I made a website from the Figma design which is interactive and responsive throughout all the pages. My goal was to make it as easy to use as possible, and to have a nice and cool design. I have explained the reasoning for my methods in the main section above.
